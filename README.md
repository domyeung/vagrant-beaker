# Beaker as a Vagrant plugin

This provides a bridge between Puppetlabs' test harness Beaker and Vagrant

## Installation

There is a gem available in the pkg/ directory for internal consumption.

```bash

  git clone git@github.com:puppetlabs/vagrant-beaker.git
  cd vagrant-beaker
  vagrant plugin install pkg/vagrant-beaker-0.0.1.gem
  vagrant add box delivery examples/box/delivery.box
  cp examples/Vagrantfiles/Vagrantfile.example1 ./Vagrantfile

```

Then either update the username and password sections in the Vagrantfile or export them as environment variables like:

```bash

  export VSPHERE_USER='justin@puppetlabs.com'
  export VSPHERE_PASSWORD='myP@$$w0rd'

```

Finally, assuming you have correct permissions withing vSphere you should be able to:

```bash

  vagrant up --provider=delivery

```

And log in via:

```bash

  vagrant ssh master

```

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

The vagrant commands `up`, `destroy`, `status`, and `halt` should work relatively correctly at this point....
